## Context

The project currently operates without a license file, creating legal ambiguity for users and potential adopters. Adding an MIT license is a straightforward administrative change that provides clear legal terms for the codebase.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Add an MIT license file to the project root
- Establish clear permissive licensing terms for the project
- Enable open-source adoption and contributions

**Non-Goals:**
- No code modifications required
- No changes to existing functionality
- No migration or deployment steps beyond file addition

## Decisions

**License Choice: MIT License**
- Chosen for its simplicity and permissive nature
- Allows broad usage including commercial applications
- Minimal requirements (preserve copyright notice and license text)
- Standard in open-source communities, well-understood

**File Naming: LICENSE**
- Using the standard `LICENSE` filename (not `LICENSE-MIT`)
- Follows common convention recognized by tools and platforms
- Makes licensing status immediately obvious to visitors

**Content: Standard MIT License Text**
- Use the official MIT License template text
- Include copyright notice with "Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holders>"
- This is a placeholder that should be updated with actual copyright holders

## Risks / Trade-offs

**Risk: Incorrect copyright holders** → Use placeholder text in the initial version; maintainers can update with proper copyright holders later

**Trade-off: MIT vs more restrictive licenses** → MIT was chosen for maximum adoption; if the project needs different terms later, license can be updated (though this requires consent of all contributors)
